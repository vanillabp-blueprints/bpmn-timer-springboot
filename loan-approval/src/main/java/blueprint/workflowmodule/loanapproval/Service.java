/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan
 * approval, expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * It never touches VanillaBP. Whenever the business case moves on, it tells
 * {@link Workflow} what happened, {@code partnerApproved} rather than "complete the
 * task", and that class decides what this means for the BPMN. The other direction runs
 * through {@link WorkflowTaskHandler}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous task splits its handling in two, and both halves are here: the process
 * asks for the partner's approval ({@link #requestPartnerApproval}), and much later the
 * answer arrives through the API ({@link #partnerDecided}). Nothing keeps the two
 * together but the task id on the workflow aggregate.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note where {@code @Transactional} sits. It is on the methods the API calls, because
 * starting a workflow and answering a task have to run in a transaction. It is
 * deliberately absent from the methods a task handler calls: VanillaBP already runs a
 * task in a transaction it owns, and a transaction declared here would break the
 * guarantees that come with it. VanillaBP sees such a transaction and fails the task
 * naming it, so the mistake shows up rather than costing data.
 * </p>
