/**
 * The workflow aggregate: one entity per workflow instance, holding everything the
 * process needs to know. There are no process variables - this is the single source of
 * truth, and it stays a normal JPA entity your application can use like any other.
 *
 * <p>
 * The attribute this blueprint is about is {@link #partnerApprovalTaskId}. A task waiting
 * for a surrounding system may wait for days, so something has to remember which task the
 * answer belongs to. The aggregate is where that belongs: it is transactional, it is
 * queryable, and it survives a restart of both sides.
