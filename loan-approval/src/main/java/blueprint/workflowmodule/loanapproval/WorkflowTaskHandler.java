/**
 * What the process tells the application: the incoming half of the BPMN wiring.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a driving adapter, the same kind of thing as {@link ApiController}: something
 * outside triggers, and the trigger is translated into a call to {@link Service}. That
 * the caller is a BPMS rather than a browser changes nothing about the direction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There is no {@code @Transactional} here, and adding one would be a mistake. VanillaBP
 * loads the aggregate, runs the method and saves the aggregate in one transaction it
 * owns. A transaction declared by the application would take that guarantee away, which
 * is why such an annotation on this class or on a {@code @WorkflowTask} method fails the
 * boot naming the method.

   * application says otherwise. Without that parameter the very same method would
   * complete the task by returning.
   *
   * <p>
   * The same method is called again if the workflow takes the task away, which
   * {@code @TaskEvent} tells apart: {@code CREATED} on delivery, {@code CANCELED} when an
   * interrupting boundary event - the deadline of this blueprint - or the end of the
   * workflow removed it. A method without a {@code @TaskEvent} parameter never
   * hears about that, and would keep a task id nobody can answer any more.
