# bpmn-timer

Adds waiting to the process: a timer in the sequence flow that delays it, and an
interrupting timer boundary event that ends a wait nobody answered. A delta on top of
`module-single`.

## Placeholders

Replace all of these consistently; they are the same in every blueprint.

Blueprint-specific names, each occurring in more than one place:

| `requestPartnerApproval` | the `@WorkflowTask` method, the Camunda 7 `camunda:delegateExpression` and the Camunda 8 `zeebe:taskDefinition` |
| `partner-rejected`       | the constant `Workflow.PARTNER_REJECTED` and the `errorCode` of `bpmn:error` in the model                       |
| `informCustomer`         | the `@WorkflowTask` method behind the waiting task and the task definition of that service task                 |
| `noteRejection`          | the `@WorkflowTask` method on the error path and the task definition of that service task                       |

The error code is the contract between code and model: if the two drift apart, the canceled
task is not caught by the boundary event and the workflow ends as an incident.

`TestApplication`, `WorkflowModuleTest`, `Simulator` and `ApplicationSmokeTest` are
identical in every blueprint - copy them unchanged.

## Adding this blueprint to an existing project

1. Model the waiting. A timer catch event in the sequence flow delays the process; an
   interrupting timer boundary event on a task ends a wait. A task that waits has to be
   able to stay open: on Camunda 7 that is `camunda:delegateExpression`, on Camunda 8 a
   plain `zeebe:taskDefinition`.
2. Add an attribute for the task id to the workflow aggregate. Without it the task cannot
   be answered later, because its id is the only handle to it.
3. Add an interface for the surrounding system, and the real client as its implementation.
   Do not call the system from `WorkflowTaskHandler`.
4. Add the `@WorkflowTask` method named after the task definition. It takes the aggregate,
   `@TaskId` for the id and `@TaskEvent` to tell delivery from cancellation, and it calls
   `Service` for each of the two. Never complete the task there.
5. Add the business methods to `Service`: one that returns early if the request went out
   already, sends it and stores the id; one that drops the id when the task was canceled;
   and one per answer the API accepts. Annotate the API-facing ones with `@Transactional`,
   never the ones the task handler calls.
6. Have the answering method reject a task id which is not the one stored on the aggregate.
   An answer arrives from outside and outlives the task it belongs to.
7. Add `completeTask` and `cancelTask` calls to `Workflow`, one method per business event,
   and keep the BPMN error code there as a constant.
8. Add the callback endpoint carrying the task id, and log the URLs continuing the process
   when the request goes out.
9. Copy `LoanApprovalIT` and write one test per way the task ends.

Do not build waiting yourself. A scheduler in the application duplicates what the BPMS
already persists, and it loses its state on every restart while a timer does not.

Never rely on the cancellation reaching your handler: not every BPMS reports it. Answering
a task that is gone is a no-op, so the correctness of your code must not depend on hearing
about it.

## Verifying

```bash
mvn install verify
```

That runs on Camunda 7, which is embedded and needs no infrastructure. `-Pcamunda8` needs a
running cluster and `vanillabp.adapters.camunda8.rest-address` configured; do not report a
failure of that profile as a defect of the generated code before having checked it.

`LoanApprovalIT` proves the aspect and has to pass:

- the surrounding system was asked once, the aggregate carries the task id, and the service
  task behind the waiting one has NOT run, which is what proves the task stays open,
- after `completeTask` that service task has run,
- after `cancelTask` the service task on the error path has run and the stored id is gone.

If the task is completed as soon as the handler returns, the model wires it in a way that
does not allow it to stay open - on Camunda 7 that is `camunda:expression`. If the workflow
ends in an incident instead of taking the error path, the error code in the code and the one
in the model differ.

Do not report success without having run this.
